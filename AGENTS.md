# pi-processes

Public Pi extension for managing background processes.

## Tool and command audience

The `process` tool is for **LLM use only**, not for users directly. Users can monitor processes via `/ps`, but they should never be the ones starting background processes — that is the agent's job.

During UI tests that require processes to be running, either give the user a prompt to send to the agent (which will start the processes via the `process` tool), or use tmux to drive it programmatically. Never instruct the user to run shell commands manually.
